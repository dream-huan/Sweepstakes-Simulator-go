[Setting]

[Probability]
5 stars acquisition probability:[0.006]
4 stars acquisition probability:[0.05]
3 stars acquisition probability:[0.944]

[Incremental]
From the [72] times onwards, the probability of obtaining 5 stars gradually increases, each increment of [0.052]
4 stars are bound to appear in [10] draws or less.

[Tips]
1.The total probability of obtaining 5 stars, 4 stars, and 3 stars must be 100%.

2.Please do not easily modify anything other than the probability data, as this may cause the program to not work properly or the probability to be inaccurate.

3.The minimum probability can only be taken to 0.001%, if the probability is less than 0.001% will be automatically taken to 0.001%.

4.Probabilities can be expressed either in fractional or decimal form.For example, [72.0%] and [0.072] have equal validity.

5.The simulation is done in a true random way.
